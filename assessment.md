# Questions and General Assessment Guidelines

* What is your general assessment of your apprentice at this point?
* What are their greatest strengths?
* What are their greatest weaknesses?
* In terms of skill and ability, do you think your apprentice is on track
  to be promoted in the expected timeframe?

This assessment will be used to make the decision
about whether the apprentice is ready to be promoted,
and to constructively work on any issues with the apprentice.

The assessment you write should not be a surprise to your apprentice.
You should be meeting with your apprentice
on a weekly basis to communicate these points to them.
